S3 vectors include factors, dates, date-times, difftimes.

## Recreate objects in R

In order to understand the structure of an object in R, we can use the `dput()` function to view how R 'recreates' this object. 

We've created two datasets in the code block below, `TestDataFrame` and `TestTibble`. Use `str()` to view their contents. 

```{r prepare-TestDataFrame-TestTibble, include=FALSE}
TestDataFrame <- data.frame(
    name = c("Pete", "Bob","Jane","Emily","Fran"),
    sex = c("Male", "Male","Female", "Female","Female"),
    score = c(78,88,92,89,84),
    age = c(42,38,26,30,35)
)
TestTibble <- tibble::tribble(
         ~name,     ~sex, ~score, ~age,
        "Pete",   "Male",     78,   42,
         "Bob",   "Male",     88,   38,
        "Jane", "Female",     92,   26,
       "Emily", "Female",     89,   30,
        "Fran", "Female",     84,   35)
```

```{r TestDataFrame-TestTibble, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-TestDataFrame-TestTibble"}
str(TestDataFrame)
str(TestTibble)
```

Now use the `dput()` to view how R 'recreates' these objects. 

```{r prepare-TestDataFrame-TestTibble-dput, include=FALSE}
TestDataFrame <- data.frame(
    name = c("Pete", "Bob","Jane","Emily","Fran"),
    sex = c("Male", "Male","Female", "Female","Female"),
    score = c(78,88,92,89,84),
    age = c(42,38,26,30,35)
)
TestTibble <- tibble::tribble(
         ~name,     ~sex, ~score, ~age,
        "Pete",   "Male",     78,   42,
         "Bob",   "Male",     88,   38,
        "Jane", "Female",     92,   26,
       "Emily", "Female",     89,   30,
        "Fran", "Female",     84,   35)
```

```{r TestDataFrame-TestTibble-dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-TestDataFrame-TestTibble-dput"}
dput(TestDataFrame)
dput(TestTibble)
```

We can see the output from `dput(TestDataFrame)` tells us `TestDataFrame` is a list comprised of four vectors (`name`, `sex`, `score`, and `age`), of class `data.frame`, 

The output of `dput(TestTibble)` tells us `TestTibble` is also a list with four vectors (`name`, `sex`, `score`, and `age`), but `TestTibble` has multiple classes: 

`class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")`

We can use the output from `dput()` to recreate each object. Copy the output from `dput()` above and paste it below to recreate `TestDataFrame` and `TestTibble`. 

```{r recreate-dput, exercise=TRUE}
TestDataFrame2 <- 
TestTibble2 <- 
# check the structure of TestDataFrame2
str(TestDataFrame2)
# check the structure of TestTibble2
str(TestTibble2)
# are they identical to the original TestDataFrame and TestTibble?
```

So far, we've used `str()`, `typeof()`, and `class()` to interrogate the contents and structure of R objects. `dput()` is a way to combine all three (and it gives you the code to 'recreate' the object, which always comes in handy!)


## Factors 

Factors are S3 vectors which hold a distinct list of labels (or levels). For example, imagine we have a character vector with a given set of responses, like the one below: 

```{r char_vector, exercise=TRUE}
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
# print the char_vector below

```

You can create factors using `factor()`. Factors give references and levels to categorical vectors. The correct order for `char_vector` is:

`Never` < `Rarely` < `Sometimes` < `Often` < `Always`

```{r prepare-fctr_vector, include=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
```

Below we convert `char_vector` into a factor vector (`fctr_vector`) using `factor()`. 

Check the levels of `fctr_vector` with `levels()`

```{r fctr_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_vector"}
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector)
# check levels
levels()
```

## Factor levels 

We need to set the levels in `fctr_vector` in the correct order, which we can do with the `levels` argument. By default, the levels are assigned alphabetically (using unique values only).

```{r prepare-fctr_vector-levels, include=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
```

Create `fctr_vector` again from `char_vector`, but this time place each level in it's correct place with the `levels` argument (inside `c()`):

`Never` < `Rarely` < `Sometimes` < `Often` < `Always`

```{r fctr_vector-levels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_vector-levels"}
# place levels in the correct order
fctr_levels <- c("", "", "", "", "")
# place fctr_levels in the levels argument 
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = )
# confirm levels 
levels()
```


```{r prepare-fctr_vector-dput, include=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
# levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", 
                "Often", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels)
```

We can check the structure of `fctr_vector` with `dput()`

```{r fctr_vector-dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_vector-dput"}
dput(fctr_vector)
```

The output of `dput()` tells us a lot about how R deals with with factors:

1. Each unique level value gets assigned an integer (in this case, 1-5)   
2. The levels have a corresponding `.Label` value    
3. The class of `fctr_vector` is `"factor"`   

The integer values are printed in the order they were supplied in `char_vector`:

`c(1L, 3L, 5L, 2L, 4L)`

```{r prepare-print-char_vector, include=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
```

```{r print-char_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-print-char_vector"}
# check against the order in char_vector
char_vector
```

`1L` = `"Never"`, `3L` = `"Sometimes"`, `5L` = `"Always"`, `2L` = `"Rarely"`, `4L` = `"Often"`

Note that the number of levels in a factor are distinct, so factors come in handy for character strings with specific and repeated categories. 

Consider the following character vectors: `mult_char_vector` and `fctr_levels`

```{r prepare-mult-char_vector, include=FALSE}
# mult_char_vector
mult_char_vector <- c("Never", "Always", "Sometimes", "Often",
                 "Always", "Rarely", "Often", "Rarely")
# fctr_levels (in order)
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", 
                "Often", "Always")
```

We've created the following vectors. 

```r
mult_char_vector <- c("Never", "Always", "Sometimes", "Often",
                 "Always", "Rarely", "Often", "Rarely")
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", 
                "Often", "Always")
```

Use the code block below to example the length of `mult_char_vector`, `fctr_levels` and the structure of `fctr_mult_vector` (after supplying `mult_char_vector` and `fctr_levels` to `factor()`). 

```{r mult-char_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-mult-char_vector"}
# fctr_levels
fctr_mult_vector <- factor(x = mult_char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels)
# check length() of mult_char_vector

# check length() of fctr_levels

# check structure (str()) of fctr_mult_vector

# How many levels are in fctr_mult_vector?
```

We can see that despite the `length()` of `mult_char_vector` being `8`, the number of levels in the `fctr_mult_vector` is constrained to `5` (the length of `fctr_levels`).

## Factor labels 

The `labels` argument can also be used to assign either 1) character values in the same order as the `levels`, or 2) a single character string that gets assigned a numerical suffix for each unique value of `levels`. 

The code block creates three factors: 

1. `fctr_with_levels`, which uses `char_vector` as `x` and `fctr_levels` as `levels`     
2. `fctr_with_labels`, which uses `char_vector` as `x` and `fctr_levels` as `levels`, and `fctr_labels` as `labels`   
3. `fctr_chr_string`, which uses `char_vector` as `x` and `fctr_levels` as `levels`, `chr_string` as `labels`  

Print each of the factors to the screen and investigate them with `dput()`

```{r prepare-fctr_labels, include=FALSE}
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", 
                "Often", "Always")
# fctr_labels
fctr_labels <- c("NEVER", "RARELY", "SOMETIMES", 
                "OFTEN", "ALWAYS")
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")

# character string length 1
chr_string <- c("FACTOR LABEL ")

# create fctr_with_levels
fctr_with_levels <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                        levels = fctr_levels)

# create fctr_with_labels
fctr_with_labels <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                        levels = fctr_levels, 
                        labels = fctr_labels)

# fctr_chr_string
fctr_chr_string <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                        levels = fctr_levels, 
                        labels = chr_string)
```


```{r fctr_labels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_labels"}
# use ls() to print each factor to the screen
ls()
# use dput() to view each factor

# how are these factors different?
```

## Ordered factors 

Sometimes it's necessary to force the factor levels into a specific order, which we can do by setting `ordered` to `TRUE`. Use the code block below to create `fct_ordered` with `char_vector` and `fctr_levels`. Print `fctr_levels` and use `dput()` to investigate it's structure. 

```{r prepare-fct_ordered, include=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always",
                 "Rarely",  "Often")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", 
                "Often", "Always")
```


```{r fct_ordered, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fct_ordered"}
# create fct_ordered
fct_ordered <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      ordered = )
# print fct_ordered 

# dput() fct_ordered

# What is different about the structure of fct_ordered?
```

Ordered factors are helpful whenever you have a variable with ranked categories (like `high` - `medium` - `low`).

## Dates 

We're going to cover three date formats in R: `"Date"`, `"POSIXlt"` and `"POSIXct"`. 

### ISO-8601

Dates come in a variety of formats, but only one correct format, and that's the [ISO-8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), or `YYYY-MM-DD`. 

Date storage formats have become such an issue, there's even an xkcd comic about it: 

```{r iso_8601.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png")
```

The `as.Date()` function converts character vectors into a date vector, provided we supply the dates in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Create the `date_vector` below and view it's structure with `str()`.

```{r date_vector, exercise=TRUE}
# character string of dates 
string_dates <- c("1800-01-01", "1920-11-05", "2020-06-26")
# create date_vector
date_vector <- as.Date(x = )
# print date_vector to the screen below:

# check the structure with str()

# what is the format of date_vector?
```

## Date-times (`POSIX`)

R also comes with a few handy functions for dates, such as `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()`, which gives us our system's current date or time. 

Use the code block below to create `current_date` and `current_time`, then print them to the screen to view their contents. 

```{r Sys-Date, exercise=TRUE}
# current_date
current_date <- Sys.Date()
# print to screen 

# current_time
current_time <- Sys.time()
# print to screen

```

Notice the difference in formats: 

- `Sys.Date()` creates a date in format `YYYY-MM-DD`  

- `Sys.time()` creates a date in format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ` 

The `current_date` and `current_time` vectors have been created again in the code block below. Explore their contents with `str()` and `dput()`:

```{r prepare-current_date-current_time, include=FALSE}
# current_date
current_date <- Sys.Date()

# current_time
current_time <- Sys.time()
```


```{r current_date-current_time, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-current_date-current_time"}
# explore with str()


# explore with dput()


# How does R create dates?
```


As you can see, these are stored as two different classes: 

- `Sys.Date()` creates date with `"Date"` class  
- `Sys.time()` creates a date with two classes, `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXt"`  

*What's the difference?*

Both classes have numeric values. These values are related to the [UNIX Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), which is January 1, 1970 (00:00:00 UTC), 

The UNIX Epoch serves as a point in time in which the computer can calculate dates *from*. The actual date and time is arbitrary, but without a fixed point in time, there's no way to quantify or measure a 'date.' For the `"Date"` class, the number represents the number of days, and for the `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXt"` classes, this represents the number of seconds (to the nearest second) since the epoch. The `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXt"` classes also both contain a time-zone (explore your system's time-zone with `Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)`). 

We can test the differences in `"Date"`, `"POSIXct"`, and `"POSIXt"` classes with the code block below. 

First, we can use the `as.numeric()` function to get the number of days/seconds since the epoch. Then, we can the number to a properly formatted version of the epoch (`"1970-01-01"` or `"1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC"`). 

In both examples, it should return today's date. 

```{r days_since_epoch, exercise=TRUE}
# current date
current_date <- Sys.Date()
# extract days 
days_since_epoch <- as.numeric(current_date)
# convert to date and add days
as.Date("1970-01-01") + 
```

```{r secs_since_epoch, exercise=TRUE}
# current time
current_time <- Sys.time()
# extract seconds
secs_since_epoch <- as.numeric(current_time)
# convert to date and add seconds
as.POSIXlt("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC") + 
```

We've created three character vectors with dates for the code block below, `chr_dates_times_tzs`, `chr_dates_times`, and `chr_dates`

```{r prepare-as-POSIXct-as-POSIXlt, include=FALSE}
# dates, times, and timezones
chr_dates_times_tzs <- c("2005-09-13 18:15:01 Zulu", 
                         "1970-01-01 12:01:27 US/Pacific", 
                         "2020-06-10 01:01:27 Israel")
# dates and times 
chr_dates_times <- c("1983-03-20 03:30:13", 
                     "1967-07-26 15:11:23", 
                     "2001-01-15 11:37:48")
# dates
chr_dates <- c("2014-08-24", 
               "1902-12-23", 
               "1955-04-01")
```

Use `as.Date()`, `as.POSIXct()` and `as.POSIXlt()` to explore each vector:

```{r as-POSIXct-as-POSIXlt, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-as-POSIXct-as-POSIXlt"}
# check with as.POSIXct()





# check with as.POSIXlt()




# how are they different?
```

In the tidyverse, we will be using the [`lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) to handle dates and times (but we won't cover that here).

## Difftimes 

Now that we've know how to create dates with `as.Date()`, `as.POSIXct()`, and `as.POSIXlt()`, we can use these functions to calculate the difference between them. 

The function for creating the distance between two time-points is `difftime()`, and it takes the following arguments:

```r
difftime(time1 = , time2 = , units = )
```

We've used the `Sys.Date()` function to create two dates (`last_year` and `two_years_ago`). Use these vectors and `difftime()` to get the duration in `"weeks"`.  

```{r prepare-difftime, include=FALSE}
last_year <- Sys.Date() - 365 
two_years_ago <- Sys.Date() - 730
```

```{r difftime, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-difftime"}
# check the structure of last_year and two_years_ago

# calculate the difftime in "days"
vec_difftime <- difftime(time1 = , time2 = , units = "")

# print vec_difftime
```

Use the `dput()` function to recreate the difftime object.  

```{r prepare-difftime-dput, include=FALSE}
last_year <- Sys.Date() - 365 
two_years_ago <- Sys.Date() - 730
vec_difftime <- difftime(time1 = last_year, 
                         time2 = two_years_ago, 
                         units = "days")
```

```{r difftime-dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-difftime-dput"}
# check vec_difftime with dput()
dput()
# how does R create difftimes?
```

We can see the structure of `vec_difftime` contains the numeric value (`365`), it's `class`, and the `units`.

## Review 

We've covered factors, dates, date-times, and difftimes. We used the `dput()` function to check their contents. In the code block below, all of the objects have been loaded (us the ls() function to view a full list). 

Feel free to explore each object with the other functions we've learned (like `class()`, `typeof()`, `head()`, and `tail()`).

```{r prepare-all, include=FALSE}
