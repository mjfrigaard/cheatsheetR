## Tidy data & Pipes

> "*`dplyr` functions work with pipes and expect tidy data.*"

There are three main tenets of tidy data:

1.  Each column contains a single **variable**\
2.  Each row contains a single **observation**\
3.  **Values** are at the intersection of variables and observations

```{r tidy-data, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='65%', out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/tidy-data.png")
```

We'll cover tidy data in more depth in the [`tidyr` tutorial](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/cheatsheetR/tutorials/tidyr-p1.html), but we recommend reading the [original paper by Hadley Wickham](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10).

### Pipes

```{r pipes, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='45%', out.width='45%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/pipes.png")
```

Pipes are an example of [syntactic sugar](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/10212/syntactic-sugar#:~:text), which are "*syntax changes in computer programming which make it easier for humans to code.*" R is a functional programming language, so before the pipe we would write *nested* function calls.

Imagine we want to apply a function (`first_function()`) to an object (`input`) which returns `first_output`, but then we want to apply a second function (`second_function()`) to `first_output` ? Without pipes, we would either have to assign the output from each function to it's own object:

```{r pipe--00, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='75%', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/pipe-00.png")
```

Or we would have to nest the function calls:

```{r pipe–01, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='85%', out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/pipe-01.png")
```

As you can see, the first option clutters up our working environment with intermediate values, and the second options forces us to read the function *from the inside out*.

Pipes solve this problem by allowing us to 'pipe' the output from one function into subsequent functions:

```{r pipe–03, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/pipe-03.png")
```

#### `%>%` or `|>`?

The cheatsheet examples use the pipe provided by the `magrittr` package, `%>%` (the `magrittr` pipe is imported as part of the `tidyverse`). As of 2021, R [version 4.1.0](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2021/000670.html) (codename "Camp Pontanezen") was released with a native pipe (`|>`). We're going to demonstrate using both because of reasons [better explained elsewhere.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-pipes.html#vs) The important thing to understand about pipes is how they restructure multiple function calls.

Use the code block below to experiment with pipes on the `x` vector:

```{r prepare-pipes, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(8.3, 3.14, 28.0001, 11.75)
```

```{r test-pipes, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=11, exercise.setup="prepare-pipes"}
# view x

# use %>% to get the mean() of x

# use |> to get the mean() of x

# use %>% to get the mean() and round() the output to 1 digit

# use |> to get the mean() and round() the output to 1 digit


```

If you're using RStudio, you can set which pipe you'd like to use under **Tools** \> **Global Options** \> **Code**: *Use native pipe operator \|\> (requires R 4.1+*)

```{r set-pipe, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/set-pipe.png")
```

## Summarise Cases

> *Apply summary functions to columns to create a new table of summary statistics. Summary functions take vectors as input and return one value.*

One of the most common manipulations we perform on any dataset is a summary. As we've covered above, tidy data contains our variable in columns, the observations for these variables as rows, and at their intersection (i.e., the true contents of any dataset) are the values.

This rectangular structure is helpful for storage and manipulation, but we typically need to condense the data into something more easily digestible (usually in the form of summary statistics).

### summarise()

In `dplyr`, the function for collapsing rows into a single number is `summarise()` (you can also use the American English version, `summarize()`).

We're going to start with a simple example using the example `X` and `Y` datasets from page 2 of the cheatsheet. Use the code block below to explore `X` and `Y`.

```{r prepare-xy-sum, echo=FALSE}
X <- tribble(
  ~a,  ~b,  ~c,
  "a", "t", 1,
  "b", "u", 2,
  "c", "v", 3
)
X <- dplyr::mutate(X, 
  across(where(is.double), as.double))
Y <- tribble(
  ~e,  ~f,  ~g,
  "a", "t", 3,
  "b", "u", 2,
  "d", "W", 1
)
Y <- dplyr::mutate(Y, 
  across(where(is.double), as.double))
```

```{r summarise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-xy-sum"}

```

We're going to summarize the numerical column `c` in table `X` using `dplyr`'s `summarise()` function in the code block below.

1.  Supply `X` to the `.data` argument.
2.  Provide the column we want to summarize (`c`) to the `…` argument using the `sum()` function to get the summation of the three numbers in `c` (i.e., as `sum(c)`):

```{r summarise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-xy-sum"}
# summarise(.data, sum())
```

The output is a new data frame/tibble summarizing all observations in the input. 

### summary functions

The figure below shows how we could create the same output without using `summarise()` and `sum()`:

```{r summarise-01-png, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/summarise-01.png")
```

As we can see, the column name in the output is identical to the code we've used to create the summary.

```{r summarise-answer-2, echo=FALSE}
X <- tribble(
  ~a,  ~b,  ~c,
  "a", "t", 1,
  "b", "u", 2,
  "c", "v", 3
)
X <- dplyr::mutate(X, 
  across(where(is.numeric), as.double))
summarise(X, sum(c))
```

If we'd like to provide a name for the summary column, we can do so using the following syntax:

```r
summarise(.data = <data>,
  column_name = summary_function(<variable>)
)
```

This essentially assigns the summary variable to a one-column tibble. Use the code block below to create a summary of column `c` in dataset `X` and name this column `c_sum`: 

```{r summarise-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-xy-sum"}
# summarise(.data, 
#  = sum(c))
```

We can use the code block below to see if the output from `summarise()` is identical to the output from `tibble()`:

```{r summarise-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.setup="prepare-xy-sum"}
# save the output below to 'z'
# summarise(.data = X, c_sum = sum(c))
identical(
  # place 'z' in argument x
  x = 
  y = tibble(c_sum = sum(1, 2, 3)))
```

### named summary functions

The figure below gives us an idea on how the output is created when we call `summarise()` and provide a name for the new column.

```{r summarise-02-png, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/summarise-02.png")
```

**NOTE**: The function we use inside `summarise()` must be capable of reducing the column contents into a single number. 

### count()

`dplyr` has a handy function for counting the number of observations, `count()`. The `count()` function returns a new data frame/tibble with the counts (or tally) of all observations. We've created a test dataset, `Z`, to practice using `count()` (below).

```{r prepare-z-count, echo=FALSE}
Z <- tribble(
   ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "d",  4, "l",
  "d",  5, "m",
  "e",  6, "m"
  )
```

```{r view-z, echo=FALSE}
Z <- tribble(
   ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "d",  4, "l",
  "d",  5, "m",
  "e",  6, "m"
  )
gt::gt(Z)
```


Use the code block below to count the `z` column in the `Z` dataset. 

```{r count-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=4, exercise.setup="prepare-z-count"}
# count the observations in the z column of the Z dataset
```


### tallying values 

With `dplyr::count()`, each value in the column(s) provided to `x` is tallied up and returned under column `n`:

```{r count-01-png, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/count-01.png")
```

## Group Cases

> *Use `group_by(.data, …, .add = FALSE, .drop = TRUE)` to create a "grouped" copy of a table grouped by columns in `...`.  `dplyr` functions will manipulate each "group" separately and combine the results.*

In the previous exercise, we covered the `count()` function. `count()` takes a dataset and specified column(s) and returns a tibble containing the 'counts' for each column value under a new `n` column. The `count()` output is created by 'grouping' the dataset by the column provided to `x`, and then summarizing it's values with `summarise(n = n())`:

```{r identical-count-group_by-summarise}
identical(
  x = count(Z, z), 
  y = group_by(Z, z) |> summarise(n = n()))
```


Below we've loaded the `sw_groups` dataset, which is a subset of the [starwars data from the `dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html), for this section. Use the code block below to explore:

```{r prepare-sw_groups, echo=FALSE}
sw_groups <- cheatsheetR::sw_groups
```

```{r explore-sw_groups, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=4, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_groups"}

```

The variables in `sw_groups` contain attributes for characters in the Star Wars films. We're going to use `group_by()` to explore how these variables differ by 'groups'. 

### grouped data structure 

Before we summarise the values in `sw_groups`, we're going to view the structure of a grouped dataset. 

In the code block below, we've piped the `sw_groups` to the `group_by()` function. Add the `sex` variable, and view the structure of this new object using `str()`. 

```{r prepare-sw_groups-str, echo=FALSE}
sw_groups <- cheatsheetR::sw_groups
```

```{r group-str, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_groups"}
# group sw_groups by sex and view the str()
sw_groups |> group_by()
```

`group_by()` returns a `grouped_df` object, but retains the tibble structures as well (`tbl_df/tbl/data.frame`). The `grouped_df` object gives us the ability to perform specialized operations when we combine it with `summarise()`.

```{r sw_species_grouped, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
sw_species_grouped <- sw_groups |> group_by(species)
str(attr(x = sw_species_grouped, which = "groups"))
```

### grouped summaries

What if we wanted to calculate the average height by sex in the `sw_groups`? 

First we supply the `sex` column to `group_by()`, and then `summarise()` the `ht` column using the `mean()` function. 

Use the code block below and complete grouped summary: 

```{r prepare-sw_groups-sum-mean, echo=FALSE}
sw_groups <- cheatsheetR::sw_groups
```

```{r group-sum-mean, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_groups-sum-mean"}
sw_groups |> 
  # group sw_groups by sex 
   group_by(___) |> 
  # calculate the mean height
   summarise(mean(___))

```

As we can see, combining `group_by()` and `summarise()` allows us to apply functions to columns and answer questions like, "*what is the average mass per home?*" or "*what is the maximum height per species?*"

```{r group-by-summarise-01, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/group-by-summarise-01.png")
```

### named grouped summaries

We can also give the grouped summaries names (like using `summarise()` in isolation). Use the code block below to name the grouped `mean()` of the `ht` column `avg_ht`. 

```{r group-sum_y-mean, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_groups-sum-mean"}
sw_groups |> 
  # group sw_groups by sex 
   group_by(sex) |> 
  # name and calculate the mean height
   summarise(___ = mean(___))
```

As we can see, naming the summary is a bit like creating a tibble with the unique (or distinct) values of the grouped column (`Z$z`), and performing the summarizing function on each set of grouped values (`sum()` in this case):

```{r group-by-summarise-02, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='85%', out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/group-by-summarise-02.png")
```

## Multiple Group Summaries 

We'll often want to create more than a single grouped summary for our data. A common set of numbers is the [five-number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary), which consists of the lowest value (`min()`), the lower quartile (`quantile(x, 0.25)`), the middle value (`median()`), the upper quartile (`quantile(x, 0.75)`), and the highest value (`max()`).

We've loaded another subset of the starwars dataset as `sw_summary` for these exercises. Use the code block below to explore:

```{r prepare-sw_summary, echo=FALSE}
sw_summary <- cheatsheetR::sw_summary
```

```{r explore-sw_summary, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_summary"}

```

### five number summary

We're going to create a five number summary for the `mass` variable grouped by `gender`. We'll start with minimum value and the lower quartile.

```{r five-number-summ-min-low_q_mass, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=9, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_summary"}
# switching pipes! 
sw_summary %>% 
  # group by gender
  group_by(______) %>% 
    summarise(
      # minimum using min(x)
      min_mass = , 
      # lower quantile using quantile(x, 0.25)
      low_q_mass = )
```

#### dealing with missing values 

You may be encountering an error message (***"Problem while computing `low_q_mass = quantile(mass, 0.25)`"***). We're seeing this error because of the missing values (`NA`) in `gender` and `mass`. We can remove the missing values from the calculation using `na.rm = TRUE`. 

Finish the five-number summary in the code block below (we've started it for you):

```{r five-number-summ-all, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=14, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_summary"}
# finish removing the missing (NA) values from mass
sw_summary %>% 
  # group by gender
  group_by(______) %>% 
    summarise(
      min_mass = min(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
      low_q_mass = quantile(mass, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
      # median using median(x)
      med_mass = ,
      # lower quantile usiing quantile(x, 0.75)
      up_q_mass = ,
      # maximum using max(x)
      max_mass =
      )
```

There are other methods for creating five-number summaries (see the [`fivenum` function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/fivenum.html) and the [`skimr` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/)).

### grouping and re-shaping

[In previous tutorials](https://mjfrigaard.shinyapps.io/tidyr-p1/) we've covered `tidyr`'s pivoting functions (`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`). We can use these functions to reshape the output table from grouped summaries. 

We'll start with `count()`. Below we've counted the `gender` and `hair` variables in `sw_summary`. 

```{r prepare-sw_summary-count, echo=FALSE}
sw_summary <- cheatsheetR::sw_summary
```

```{r count-gender-hair, eval=FALSE}
sw_summary %>%
  count(gender, hair)
```

```{r , echo=FALSE}
sw_summary <- cheatsheetR::sw_summary
sw_summary %>%
  count(gender, hair)
```


This output is a little long, so we want to convert it into a cross-tabulation display, with the values of `gender` making up the column names, and the counts for `hair` making up the cell counts. We can do this by pivoting the output from count into a wide format with `tidyr::pivot_wider()` (review it [here](https://mjfrigaard.shinyapps.io/tidyr-p1/#section-reshape-data)). 

In the code block below, assign `gender` to the `names_from` argument, and `n` to `values_from`:

```{r pivot_wider-count, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_summary-count"}
sw_summary %>%
  count(gender, hair) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ______, 
              values_from = _)
```

This display allows us to look up the counts of hair color by `gender` (and see which values are missing).

Let's try another example!

Below we're going to calculate some summary statistics for the mass and height variables. We'll get the mean and standard deviation, grouped by `gender`, but then convert the output into a long (tidy) format using the `tidyr::pivot_longer()` function. Complete the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions, the store the new summary column names in `'stat'` and the new summary values in `'value'`. 

```{r pivot_longer-summarise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=16, exercise.setup="prepare-sw_summary-count"}
sw_summary %>% 
  # group by gender
  group_by(______) %>% 
  # get mean and sd for mass and ht
  summarise(
    mean_mass = mean(___, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_ht = mean(__, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd_mass = sd(____, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_ht = sd(__, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  # convert to tidy format 
  pivot_longer(cols = -gender, 
               # new column names
              names_to = ______, 
              # new column values 
              values_to = _______)
```
